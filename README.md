# Configs

Configs for games:
- Quake: for a few engines, some are neglected. Focused there on achieving Kex/DOS like feel and visuals (can be switched on-fly).
- Quake 2: mainly for q2pro's multiplayer, jump mod. For beginners and veterans. Currently most active here.

# q2pro

Paks were downloaded from [quake2download.pl](https://quake2download.pl).
Not sure if I can upload them, so they were not added to this repo,
see `.gitignore` for full list.

# q2repro

Paks were downloaded from [tastyspleen.net](https://tastyspleen.net) Discord.
Not sure if I can upload them, so they were not added to this repo,
see `.gitignore` for full list. After finishing with q2pro I'll
move some focus here as well.
